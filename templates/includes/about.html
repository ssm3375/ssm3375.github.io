                    Since hardware vulnerabilities are relatively newer and lack the mature support and response ecosystem that exists for software vulnerabilities, we created this page to track and analyze all known hardware-related CVEs. This resource helps identify who submitted each vulnerability, what sources were cited, and how these issues are being documented across the ecosystem. By aggregating this data, our goal is to provide greater visibility into hardware threat reporting and support a more transparent security response.
